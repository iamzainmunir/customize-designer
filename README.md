# Custom Designer

Let your customers design their own products before they buy. Baskets, backpacks, sweaters—whatever you sell—they can personalize with text, colors, and icons, then download or save their design to share.

## What it does

**Custom Designer** is a product customization tool for your store. Customers pick a product, add their own text (names, messages, monograms), choose colors, and place icons on a live preview. When they’re done, they can:

- **Download** their design as a high-quality image
- **Save** it and get a shareable link to view or edit later

You control what products and options appear through a simple admin panel.

## How customers use it

1. **Choose a product** — Select a category (e.g. Baskets, Backpacks, Sweaters).
2. **Pick options** — Size, color, and any other options you’ve set up.
3. **Add text** — Type names, dates, or messages. Drag text on the preview to position it.
4. **Add icons** — Choose from icons (hearts, stars, etc.) and drag them onto the design.
5. **Download or save** — Export the design as an image, or save it to get a link they can share.

Everything is draggable on the canvas, so customers can place text and icons exactly where they want.

## Admin panel

Store owners use the admin panel to:

- **Manage categories** — Add products (baskets, backpacks, sweaters, etc.) and set up options like size and color.
- **Configure options** — Define what customers can customize: sizes, product colors, text fields, icons, and more.
- **Upload product images** — Add images for each variation (e.g. each size/color combo).
- **Site settings** — Set your logo, buy link (e.g. to Etsy or your shop), and how long saved designs are kept.

The admin panel includes a **Help** section that explains each option type and how to use it.
